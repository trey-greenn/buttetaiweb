BuffetAI: Personal AI-Powered Newsletter Platform
BuffetAI is a content mastery platform designed to help individuals control their information diet — by choosing exactly what topics they want to read, learn, and grow in.

📬 Newsletter Tool: Automate Your Learning
The Newsletter Tool is BuffetAI’s flagship product that lets users:

Create personalized newsletter sections by selecting topics (e.g., “AI in Healthcare” or “Emerging Markets”), writing custom instructions, and choosing a frequency (daily, weekly, biweekly).

Automatically pull the latest articles on their topics using a News API.

Use OpenAI-powered summarization to generate concise, digestible insights from the raw content.

Receive a beautifully formatted AI-generated newsletter via email, without needing to write or compile anything themselves.

Choose to Send Now (instant preview) or Schedule Later (automated future delivery).

Let the system run in the background — no ongoing work required.

🎯 Key Value Proposition
“BuffetAI helps you read with intention, not impulse.”

Instead of being overwhelmed by endless newsfeeds or unfiltered content, BuffetAI lets users decide what they learn — and delivers clean, insightful, AI-curated newsletters straight to their inbox, on their schedule.

It’s like having a private research assistant + newsletter editor, always working in the background.
